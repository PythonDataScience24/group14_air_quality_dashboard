# Air quality dashboard in Python
This repository contains a simple air quality dashboard programmed in Python. 

As this repository is part of a group project in an university course dedicated to Python, we will implement to dashboard from A to Z in python. Data is thereby pulled from the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality database, as well as some local resources for some countries (e.g. Switzerland). Our goal is further to render the dashboard interactive by using Dash, a Python framework for building dynamic analytical web application.
